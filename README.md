2025- Spring- MyPackage Tracker is a real- time package tracking application designed for small businesses that manage their own delivery services. Many small businesses, such as restaurants, coffee, shops, or other retailers struggle with maintaining deliveries and keeping customers informed about the status of their orders. Larger companies, such as Amazon or eBay, have sophisticated tracking systems, but small businesses often have limited resources and availability to implement some of these solutions. MyPackage Tracker is an application that bridges the gap by providing an easy to use, affordable and customizable tracking system that keeps customers updated and helps business owners optimize delivery routes.
