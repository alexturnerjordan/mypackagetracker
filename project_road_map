**My To-Do List**

- [x] Find a Github repository to use. Found a repsoitory that is very similar to my project. Theirs is more complex, as it deals with also ordering in the actual application itself. https://github.com/ksu-is/OrderTrackingSystem
- [x] Update readme, commit changes, create project roadmamp.
- [x] Set up SQLite database connection
- [x] Add order input logic and validation for Package ID
- [x] Implement logic for determining foreign port based on item count
- [x] Calculate and store tracking dates for package delivery
- [x] Save data into SQLite database for both order and tracking tables
- [ ] Add functions to retrieve and display tracking status for a specific order
- [ ] Create user-friendly interface for viewing all orders
-
 Emerging Tasks
- [ ] Add error logging to file instead of console
- [ ] Create JSON export of order data
